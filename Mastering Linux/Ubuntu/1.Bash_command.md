# The Command echo

# Test:

echo 'Bash is amazing!'              # return Bash is amazing!

# echo = command/program ,  'Bash is amazing!' = argument(s)
# string that we want to print should be wrapped in 'single quotes'

echo -n 'Bash is amazing!'          # return   Bash is amazing! with no line break between the command and the next line.

# echo = command , -n = option(s) , 'Bash is amazing!' = arguments 
# Bash command = echo -n 'Bash is amazing!'
