# Modulo operator

# Understanding the modulo operator examples

10 / 5 = 2              # 2 is the outcome of the division
            
10 % 5 = 0              # 0 is the remainder as 10 /5 is a division without remainder 

# Example 2

10 / 3 = 3.3333333      # 10 / 3 return a decimal as it is not a clean division since 3 is not a factor of 10 => 10/3 = 3 with 1 remainder

10 % 3 = 1              # 10 % 3 return 1 as 1 is te remainder from the unclean division.
