Step 1: Retrieve IP Address from CentOS

    From the CentOS Desktop, open the Terminal.
    Type the following command and press Enter:

    ip addr show

    Look for the bridge adapter (e.g., 3: enp0s8: .......).
    Record the IP address from the bridge adapter. The format will be something like 192.1XX.1.XX/YY, but only record the IP address portion (e.g., 192.1XX.1.XX).

Step 2: Record the CentOS Username

    From the terminal, note the CentOS username displayed in the prompt (e.g., [abcdef@CentOSvm ~]), where abcdef is the username.

Step 3: SSH from the Host OS (using Git Bash)

    On your Host OS, open Git Bash.
    In Git Bash, type the following command and press Enter:

ssh username@ip_address

    Replace username with your CentOS username (e.g., abcdef).
    Replace ip_address with the IP address you recorded earlier (e.g., 192.1XX.1.XX).
    Example:

        ssh abcdef@192.1XX.1.XX

Step 4: Confirm Connection

    When prompted with the message:

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 

    Type yes and press Enter.
    You will then be prompted for the password. Enter the CentOS user password and press Enter.

Step 5: Verify SSH Connection

    Once logged in, you should see the terminal prompt change to indicate you're connected to the CentOS system.
    To verify the IP address on Git Bash, run the following command:

ip addr show

    The output should match the IP address you noted earlier from the CentOS Terminal.

To check the hostname, type the following command in Git Bash:

    hostname

        This will display the hostname of your CentOS system.

Step 6: Exit and Shutdown CentOS

    To exit the SSH session, type:

exit

You can now safely shut down CentOS from VirtualBox.
